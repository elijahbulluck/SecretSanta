This program is a Secret Santa random generator that is used within my family, since most of the other ones I have seen online require to see everyone's
gifter and receiver after entering their names, and I wanna participate too!
To run it, type in "ruby main.rb" from the command line within the SecretSanta folder. (make sure you have twilio gem installed, run the command "gem install twilio-ruby")
After executing this statement, you will be prompted for your Twilio account SID,
authorization token, and phone number (assuming you have an account that is 
toll-free message verified). After you enter your information, you will be prompted
to enter the names and phone numbers of each participant, and type "done" when finished.
When finished, the participants will be shuffled and each persons Secret Santa will be sent to them
via SMS text message.

Merry Christmas!
